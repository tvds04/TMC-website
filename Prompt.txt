You are a senior web designer specializing in professional, corporate websites for business organizations. Your task is to create a clean, minimal website for the Technology Management Club (TMC), an undergraduate business technology club at Indiana University's Kelley School of Business.

# CONTEXT & GOALS

**About TMC:**
- Undergraduate business technology club at IU Kelley School of Business
- Focus: Technology management, consulting, and professional development
- Audience: Current Kelley students (recruitment) AND existing members (engagement)
- Brand personality: Professional, corporate (think McKinsey/Deloitte aesthetic), tech-forward but business-focused

**Design Objective:**
Create a multi-page website that equally serves two purposes:
1. Recruit new members (showcase value, events, opportunities)
2. Engage current members (event updates, resources, community)

# BRAND GUIDELINES

**Colors:**
- Primary: TMC Blue #01679b
- Secondary: TMC Maroon #8f0002
- Neutrals: Use professional grays, whites for balance
- Accent: Consider subtle tech-inspired accent colors

**Typography:**
- Primary: Modern sans-serif (Inter, Work Sans, or similar professional font)
- Hierarchy: Clear heading styles, readable body text
- Note: TMC's traditional fonts are Gowun Batang/Times New Roman, but prioritize modern sans-serif for web

**Logo:**
- File: TMC_Logo.png (located in current folder)
- Design: Handshake with circuit board pattern
- Usage: Prominent in header, appropriate sizing

# SITE STRUCTURE

**Multi-Page Navigation:**
Create separate pages with clean navigation:

1. **Home Page**
   - Hero section: Compelling tagline, high-quality image, clear CTA ("Join TMC" button)
   - Brief overview: What TMC does (2-3 sentences)
   - Upcoming events preview (next 3-5 events with "See all events" link)
   - Why Join section with rotating member testimonials
   - Instagram feed integration (latest 6-9 posts)
   - Footer: Contact, social links, quick links

2. **About Page**
   - Comprehensive About TMC section:
     * Mission statement
     * Values
     * What we do (event types, opportunities, member benefits)
     * Club history/achievements (use content from AI_CONTEXT folder)
   - Executive Board section:
     * Leadership team with photos (if available in folder)
     * Names, titles, brief bios or roles
     * Professional card-style layout
   - Sponsors/Partners (if applicable from AI_CONTEXT)

3. **Events Page**
   - Current Semester Calendar section:
     * Upcoming events in card/list format
     * Filter by event type (workshops, networking, case competitions, social events, speaker series)
     * Each event shows: date, time, location, brief description, event type tag
     * "Load more" button for additional events
     * "Add to calendar" functionality for each event
   - Past Events section:
     * Highlights from last 2-3 semesters (from AI_CONTEXT folder and Instagram content)
     * Image gallery/carousel for each major event
     * Brief description, date, attendance/impact metrics if available

     * Member testimonials (rotating/animated cards with quotes, names, graduation years)
     * Success stories (where past members are now)
   - How to Join:
     * Membership requirements
     * Application process or meeting times
     * Timeline (when recruitment happens)

     * Functional form with fields: Name, Email, Year, Major, Why interested in TMC
     * "Submit" button that validates input
     * Success message after submission
   - FAQ section (if content available in AI_CONTEXT)

# INTERACTIVE FEATURES (CRITICAL)

**Must implement:**
1. ✅ Calendar event filtering by type (dropdown or tag-based)
2. ✅ Image galleries/carousels for past events (smooth transitions)
3. ✅ Rotating/animated member testimonials (auto-rotate every 5-7 seconds)
4. ✅ Functional contact form (client-side validation, clear success/error states)
5. ✅ Live Instagram feed integration (display recent posts with images)
6. ✅ "Add to calendar" buttons for events (generate .ics files)
7. ✅ Smooth scroll navigation between sections
8. ✅ Responsive mobile design (mobile-first approach)

# DESIGN REQUIREMENTS

**Aesthetic:**
- Professional/Corporate style (consulting firm inspiration: clean lines, ample white space, sophisticated)
- Minimal but not sparse: purposeful use of space
- High-quality imagery (professional photos, not stock when possible)
- Subtle animations (hover effects, fade-ins, but not distracting)
- Accessibility: WCAG AA compliant (contrast ratios, alt text, semantic HTML)

**Layout Principles:**
- Clear visual hierarchy (F-pattern reading flow)
- Consistent spacing system (8px grid recommended)
- Card-based components for events, testimonials, exec board
- Strategic use of TMC brand colors (not overwhelming)
- Professional photography with subtle overlays/gradients where needed

**Technical:**
- Single HTML file per page (or React component if using frontend-design skill)
- Embedded CSS (or separate stylesheet if cleaner)
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactions (or React hooks)
- Responsive breakpoints: Mobile (<768px), Tablet (768-1024px), Desktop (>1024px)
- Optimized images (consider lazy loading for galleries)
- Fast load times (minimize heavy assets)

# FILE STRUCTURE & CONTENT SOURCES

**Available Resources:**
- TMC_Logo.png: Club logo (current folder)
- AI_CONTEXT folder Contains:
  * Images from Google Drive (use placeholder images initially, note where to swap)
  * Club description text
  * Instagram content for past events in HTML format (integrate into Past Events section)
- User will later add: images from past club events

**Content Integration:**
- Read AI_CONTEXT folder thoroughly to inform all sections
- Use actual club information, don't make up details
- Where content is TBD: add clear placeholder text like "[ADD: Club mission statement]"
- For images: use placeholder images with comments: "<!-- Replace with: [description] from Google Drive -->"

# SUCCESS CRITERIA

**The website is successful if:**
1. ✅ Professional appearance that matches corporate/consulting aesthetic
2. ✅ Clear value proposition for prospective members (Why Join is compelling)
3. ✅ Easy for current members to find event information
4. ✅ All interactive features work smoothly (filters, carousels, form, Instagram feed)
5. ✅ Mobile-responsive and accessible
6. ✅ Fast loading, clean code
7. ✅ TMC brand colors and logo properly integrated
8. ✅ Content from AI_CONTEXT folder is accurately represented
9. ✅ Clear placeholders for user-provided content (images, final text)
